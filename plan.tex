\section{Planning and team(s) fro DP0} \label{sec:plan}


\subsection {Teams}

The Operations era org chart is shown in \figref{fig:org}.

\end{figure}

The main departments involved in DP0 are Data Production and System Performance. With in those departments various people will be involved from the underlying teams but in small numbers. It makes most sense to approach DP0 with a task force approach. This might best be seen as two teams:

\begin{itemize}
\item Data production - with a focus on middleware and execution (\secref{sec:dp});
\item System Performance - with a focus on quality assurance and community support (\secref{sec:sp}).
\end{itemize}

As we advance the teams grow and we will transition to the an organization as in \figref{fig:org}
with team leads for each team.

\subsection{DP Middleware and Execution}\label{sec:dp}
For DP0 on IDF Hsin-Fang Chiang would coordinate Data Production activities and be the point
of contact for the IDF provider.
There is preops effort (fractional FTE) available in Execution and Pipelines as well as Middleware teams.
The roles etc need some clean up from the ops proposal but the DP Roles are listed in \tabref{tab:teams} though the exact mix of roles is still under discussion.


\subsection{SP Quality  and Community Support} \label{sec:sp}

Note: DP0.1 and DP0.2 Early Access described in this document do not leave time for full-scale quality analysis. The provided data will not be science-ready; system performance milestones are succeeding.

\subsection{Planning}


\input{tables/timeline}
Table \ref{tab:timeline} lists internal timeline.

\subsubsection{Middleware}
There are obvious middleware milestones such as DP-MW-M-01 read only Gen3 Butler which are needed from the construction project.
There is still installation work needed for the that on Google which includes the need for a Postgress (like) database for the registry. The DAX team are on the hook for this.
For DP0.2 we need Butler to handle processing, not just locating files (DP-MW-M-04).

\paragraph{Qserv} should be installed  and configured. Though we have some prior art for this we
still will need some experimentation to get it correct. Getting DC2 loaded in Qserv is also a DAX activity
we will have to do on IDF.

\paragraph{Workflow} needs to be functioning at scale for DP0.2, ideally we should basic workflow
early on (milestone DP-MW-M-02). Then more tooling such as restarting failed jobs (DP-MW-M-03)

\subsubsection{ Science Platform}
The science platform and web services need to be deployed. In principle this is reasonable straight forward, an open issue may be configuring of the Portal aspect for the chosen  dataset(s).

\subsubsection{ Pipelines }
For DP0.2 we need a Gen3 version of the pipelines to process the dataset. This will have to run at scale for PDR2 or DC2. There may be several runs for quality purposes.
Fractional FTE from the Pipelines will provide help in pipeline configuration, data repo preparation, workflow consulting, science verification, data model documenting, troubleshooting, and liaisoning.

\subsubsection{ IN2P3}
IN2P3 will contribute in Qserv and pipelines. {\bf Fabio will provide more information here.}
