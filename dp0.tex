\subsection{Risks and mitigation}

The biggest schedule risk is not getting an interim data facility in place in time.
This would delay the entire schedule and there is not much mitigation.

In the long run costs may be higher than expected in a cloud based IDF. This will be due to storage.
An mitigation to this would be to store data on our own systems (NCSA or Chile) and expose it through S3.
NCSA already have this in place and we should consider testing this for lesser used data sets.
